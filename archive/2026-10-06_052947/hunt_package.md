  - Falsification criterion: If autoruns, scheduled tasks, services, and WMI subscriptions show no Cobalt Strike-aligned artifacts, post-execution persistence is disproven.
  - Data sources: Sysmon EID 13/12, Autoruns sweep, EDR persistence module
  - Suggested query: `registry_set | where key matches /Run|RunOnce|Image File Execution Options/ and value matches /unusual-path/`
- **[H-873948f2-2-O4] AV / quarantine retrospective** _(difficulty: easy · 100 pts · MITRE: T1204)_
  - Falsification criterion: If retrospective AV / quarantine logs show no detections for related signatures over the last 30 days, the family is unlikely to have landed in-environment.
  - Data sources: AV management console, Defender ATP detections
  - Suggested query: `av_events | where signature contains 'Cobalt Strike' | summarize by host, action`
- **[H-873948f2-2-O5] Memory-resident loader check** _(difficulty: hard · 300 pts · MITRE: T1620, T1055)_
  - Falsification criterion: If a memory scan (YARA via EDR / Volatility) finds none of the published loader patterns on a sampled set of high-risk hosts, in-memory residency is unsupported.
  - Data sources: YARA via EDR, Volatility on a sampled host
  - Suggested query: `memory_scan | yara_rule == 'rule_cobalt_strike' | summarize by host`

#### H-873948f2-3 · Outbound C2 beaconing to reported infrastructure  _(confidence: high)_

**Statement.** Hosts in the estate are beaconing to the command-and-control infrastructure reported in this article (domains, IPs, TLS fingerprints, or RMM tooling).

**Why this hypothesis?** Archetype 'c2_beacon' selected based on malware families: Cobalt Strike; vectors: phishing, exploit, cloud-misconfig; impact: data-breach, espionage, fraud; products: Microsoft 365 / Entra ID.

**MITRE ATT&CK**: T1071, T1573, T1219

**CTF objectives (5) — find evidence that disproves the hypothesis:**

- **[H-873948f2-3-O1] DNS resolution sweep for published C2 domains** _(difficulty: easy · 100 pts · MITRE: T1071.004)_
  - Falsification criterion: If recursive DNS logs show zero resolutions for the IOC domains in the last 90 days, active beaconing is disproven.
  - Data sources: DNS resolver logs, Passive DNS
  - Suggested query: `dns | where query in ('rsproxy.cn','d32tpl7xt7175h.cloudfront.net','osc-cdn.com') | summarize count() by client_ip`
- **[H-873948f2-3-O2] Egress connections to published C2 IPs** _(difficulty: medium · 200 pts · MITRE: T1071, T1573)_
  - Falsification criterion: If proxy / firewall egress logs show no connections to the IOC IPs or matching ASNs, network-level C2 is unsupported.
  - Data sources: Proxy logs, NetFlow, Firewall accept logs
  - Suggested query: `egress | where dst_ip in ('103.27.110.220') | summarize bytes_out = sum(bytes_sent) by src_ip`
- **[H-873948f2-3-O3] Beacon periodicity / jitter analysis** _(difficulty: hard · 300 pts · MITRE: T1071, T1095)_

> Overview Rapid7 tracked a set of Linux samples that blend into the software and device conventions of the telecom environments they target. The set spans a newly observed BPFDoor variant, a BPF Rekoobe build seen against South Korean targets, a dropper, and six builds of a Linux implant we track as AVERAT , deployed against Taiwanese appliances. Additionally, we provide source code details of the Rapid7 BPFDoor controller introduced in our April 2026 blog, Stealthy BPFDoor Variants are a Needle That Looks Like Hay . The chain uses two binaries. A dropper writes a shell script to the appliance's storage mount and executes it. The script stages both payloads into /sbin under the names ntpdate and udevds , launches them, and deletes each file ten seconds later while the processes continue running. One of those payloads is the dropper itself, re-executing as a resident watchdog, leaving both processes running without an on-disk image. The dropper derives its encryption key from the string ShareTech and lives in the appliance's own add-on package directory. The BPFDoor variants seen against South Korean systems impersonate the PID file of SpamSniper, a Korean anti-spam product, and rotate through ten Linux daemon names. Across the samples, each component adopts names and conventions designed to look unremarkable in the environment it targets. The common thread is regionalized disguise: each sample is aware of the vendor’s software running on the targeted systems and implements pro

A management interface subsequently returns this stored value in a JSON response, and the web interface responsible for displaying update information inserts that value directly into the page as HTML. This behavior allows attacker‑controlled metadata to be interpreted as script content. In addition, the same authenticated origin provides an interface capable of executing system‑level commands with root privileges. An attacker able to influence update metadata could exploit these conditions to execute arbitrary code within the administrative context of the device. View CVE Det

> Overview On September 30, 2026, Cisco published a security advisory for CVE-2026-76504 , a critical API authentication bypass vulnerability affecting Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager. The vulnerability has a CVSSv3.1 score of 9.8 and results from improper handling of URL encoding ( CWE-177 ). An unauthenticated, remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP request that bypasses an authentication rule for a specific API endpoint, gaining access to the API with the privileges of the admin user. According to Cisco, CVE-2026-76504 is being actively exploited in the wild; Cisco PSIRT became aware of the activity in September 2026. Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager systems with ports exposed to the internet are at risk of compromise. The vulnerability affects the product regardless of system configuration, and Cisco has not provided a workaround, however vendor supplied updates are available. Rapid7 strongly recommends that organizations upgrade affected systems to a fixed release on an emergency basis, outside of normal patch cycles, and investigate internet-facing systems for signs of exploitation. Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager was also affected by two critical, unauthenticated peering authentication flaws earlier in 2026: CVE-2026-20127 and Rapid7-discovered CVE-2026-20182 . Both were distinct issues in the vdaemon service and similar parts of its networking stack. CVE-2026-76504 targets a separate API authentication path, but the recurrence of authentication bypasses in internet-facing Cat

> CISA is amplifying Citrix’s disclosure of eight new vulnerabilities affecting Citrix NetScaler ADC and Citrix NetScaler Gateway products: CVE-2026-88771 , CVE-2026-88772 , CVE-2026-88773 , CVE-2026-88774 , CVE-2026-88775 , CVE-2026-88776 , CVE-2026-88777 , and CVE-2026-88778 . CISA has added CVE-2026-88771 and CVE-2026-88772 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog . Both are critical, zero-day vulnerabilities that can independently enable remote code execution. CISA has received reports and partner threat intelligence confirming that threat actors are actively exploiting these vulnerabilities globally. Because updating Citrix NetScaler appliances can be complex and may require downtime, CISA is issuing this Alert to help organizations assess exposure, prioritize mitigation, and account for these vulnerabilities into their risk-management activities. Given the potential consequences of successful exploitation and the fact that malicious actors are exploiting at least some of these vulnerabilities, CISA urges users and administrators to review Citrix’s advisories. If possible, users are encouraged to check for indication of compromise prior to patching. Citrix has made indicators of compromise available through NetScaler Console and published additional guidance in their recent publication, Security Bulletin for CVE-2026-88771 through CVE-2026-88778 , to support organizations in assessing potential compromise. Should your organization suspect compromise, it is impo

> Business Email Compromise (BEC) operates on a familiar playbook. Threat actors breach a mailbox, silently monitor operations, map approval chains, and ultimately exploit that access to divert funds or exfiltrate sensitive assets. This dynamic is central to our analysis as we kick off a series around Rapid7's collaborative research with Zimbra; upcoming installments will explore technical details and broader findings based within the Zimbra Collaboration Suite. Our investigation disrupted the traditional BEC model in unexpected ways. We uncovered over 50 vulnerabilities, and found that several allow attackers not just to observe environments, but to actively rewrite them by impersonating senders without credentials, controlling inbox visibility, and altering shared documents and calendars. Business Email Compromise in action: Digital abuse of trust None of this is theoretical for Zimbra. But don’t take my word for it, just ask Russia . CISA keeps putting Zimbra bugs into the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog , and the last three years make the point on their own: CVE-2024-45519 , command injection in the postjournal service, unauthenticated command execution. Proofpoint saw attackers stuffing base64 payloads into CC fields on September 28, 2024. CISA added it to KEV on October 3. CVE-2025-27915 , stored XSS in the Classic Web Client, triggered by a crafted .ICS attachment. It is used as a zero-day against Brazilian military targets to steal mail and quietly set forwardin

> View CSAF Summary A Client Code Execution (CCE) vulnerability has been identified in Desigo CC, potentially allowing malicious actors to execute arbitrary code on client devices through specially crafted graphics documents. This vulnerability leverages user-defined graphics containing embedded scripts that are executed on client application instances. Successful exploitation could lead to compromise of the client operating system and potential lateral movement within the organization. The following versions of Siemens Desigo CC family are affected: Desigo CC family V6 vers:all/* (CVE-2026-34223) Desigo CC family V7 vers:all/* (CVE-2026-34223) CVSS Vendor Equipment Vulnerabilities v3 8.2 Siemens Siemens Desigo CC family Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') Background Critical Infrastructure Sectors: Critical Manufacturing, Commercial Facilities Countries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide Company Headquarters Location: Germany Vulnerabilities Expand All + CVE-2026-34223 The affected application is vulnerable to Client Code Execution (CCE) due to insufficient input validation when handling scripts embedded within user-defined graphics documents. Specifically, when the script within a graphics document is designed or modified by an attacker to include malicious commands. When a user opens a compromised graphics document, the embedded script is executed on the client application instance, allowing an attacker to write arbitrary files to the client's operating system.

> Overview On September 22, 2026, F5 published a security advisory for CVE-2026-94127 , a critical heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability affecting F5 BIG-IP Access Policy Manager (APM). The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8. An unauthenticated attacker with network access to an affected virtual server may be able to achieve remote code execution (RCE) by sending specifically crafted traffic. BIG-IP APM provides identity-aware access control for applications and other corporate resources and can integrate with authentication technologies including OAuth, OpenID Connect, and SAML. CVE-2026-94127 is not exposed in a default configuration: exploitation requires a BIG-IP virtual server with both an APM access policy and an OAuth profile configured. Because affected BIG-IP systems may process traffic at an organization's network edge, organizations using this configuration should prioritize remediation. The vulnerability affects the data plane and does not expose the BIG-IP control plane. BIG-IP systems operating in Appliance mode are also affected. F5 lists the following affected release trains and corresponding fixed hotfixes: BIG-IP 21.1.0: versions prior to Hotfix-BIGIP-21.1.0.2.0.30.22-ENG BIG-IP 17.5.0: versions prior to Hotfix-BIGIP-17.5.1.9.0.160.12-ENG BIG-IP 17.1.0: versions prior to Hotfix-BIGIP-17.1.3.5.0.41.14-ENG As of September 22, 2026, CVE-2026-94127 has been added to the CISA KEV while a publicly available proof of concept was not confirmed.

> Overview On September 27, 2026, Citrix disclosed eight new vulnerabilities affecting NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway, including two critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities: CVE-2026-88771 and CVE-2026-88772 . Both of these RCE vulnerabilities carry a critical CVSSv4 score of 9.5, and both have been confirmed as being actively exploited in the wild as zero-days prior to the vendor disclosure . CVE-2026-88771 affects vulnerable NetScaler deployments in their default configuration, with no additional product features required. The vendor has also indicated that the attack complexity for exploiting CVE-2026-88771 is low, meaning reliable RCE is likely against all vulnerable NetScaler appliances regardless of their configuration. This is especially concerning due to the prevalence of NetScaler appliances. CVE-2026-88772 is a memory corruption vulnerability and requires the DTLS feature to be enabled on the appliance. The vendor has indicated that the attack complexity is high, meaning achieving reliable exploitation may be more difficult for an attacker than that of CVE-2026-88771. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) reports active exploitation is occurring globally, and added both CVE-2026-88771 and CVE-2026-88772 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog on September 27, 2026. Multiple CERTs worldwide have begun issuing alerts due to the critical nature of this situation. The following table summarizes all eight vulnerabil

> CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog , based on evidence of active exploitation. CVE-2026-88771 Citrix NetScaler Improper Input Validation Vulnerability CVE-2026-88772 Citrix NetScaler Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer Vulnerability These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-04: Prioritizing Security Updates Based on Risk establishes vulnerability management requirements for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. BOD 26-04 reinforces the importance of the KEV Catalog and requires federal agencies to prioritize rapid remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities, specifically those identified by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) listed in CISA’s KEV Catalog on publicly exposed assets that grant total control of the asset post-exploitation, while deferring action for lower-risk vulnerabilities. BOD 26-04 further establishes basic expectations for when agencies must check whether threat actors compromised the system before the patch was applied. While BOD 26-04 applies only to FCEB agencies, CISA encourages all organizations to adopt risk-based vulnerability management and prioritize remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities . CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria . Aware of an exploit

> CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog , based on evidence of active exploitation. CVE-2026-87902 WordPress Core Remote File Inclusion Vulnerability This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and poses significant risks to the federal enterprise. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-04: Prioritizing Security Updates Based on Risk establishes vulnerability management requirements for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. BOD 26-04 reinforces the importance of the KEV Catalog and requires federal agencies to prioritize rapid remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities, specifically those identified by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) listed in CISA’s KEV Catalog on publicly exposed assets that grant total control of the asset post-exploitation, while deferring action for lower-risk vulnerabilities. BOD 26-04 further establishes basic expectations for when agencies must check whether threat actors compromised the system before the patch was applied. While BOD 26-04 applies only to FCEB agencies, CISA encourages all organizations to adopt risk-based vulnerability management and prioritize remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities . CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria . Aware of an exploited vulnerability not currently listed in the KEV Catalog? Submit it for potential addition through CISA’s KEV Nomination Form . P

  - Suggested query: `patch_state | where kb in (fixes_for('CVE-2026-64892')) | summarize coverage = avg(installed) by host_role`
- **[H-edf239d6-1-O4] Post-exploit web-shell sweep** _(difficulty: medium · 250 pts · MITRE: T1505.003, T1059)_
  - Falsification criterion: If a sweep of webroots and IIS/Apache process trees finds no anomalous children (cmd, powershell, /bin/sh) on the affected product hosts, post-exploit foothold is unsupported.
  - Data sources: EDR process telemetry, File integrity monitoring
  - Suggested query: `process | where parent in ('w3wp.exe','httpd','nginx','java') and child in ('cmd.exe','powershell.exe','/bin/sh','/bin/bash')`
- **[H-edf239d6-1-O5] Honeypot / canary check** _(difficulty: hard · 300 pts · MITRE: T1190)_
  - Falsification criterion: If exposed canary instances of the same product show no probing or exploitation telemetry, opportunistic mass-exploitation against the org is unlikely.
  - Data sources: Honeypot logs, Canary tokens
  - Suggested query: `canary_events | where product == '<product>' | where event_type in ('probe','exploit') | summarize by src_ip`

#### H-edf239d6-2 · Outbound C2 beaconing to reported infrastructure  _(confidence: high)_

**Statement.** Hosts in the estate are beaconing to the command-and-control infrastructure reported in this article (domains, IPs, TLS fingerprints, or RMM tooling).

**Why this hypothesis?** Archetype 'c2_beacon' selected based on CVEs cited: CVE-2026-64892; vectors: exploit.

**MITRE ATT&CK**: T1071, T1573, T1219

**CTF objectives (5) — find evidence that disproves the hypothesis:**

- **[H-edf239d6-2-O1] DNS resolution sweep for published C2 domains** _(difficulty: easy · 100 pts · MITRE: T1071.004)_
  - Falsification criterion: If recursive DNS logs show zero resolutions for the IOC domains in the last 90 days, active beaconing is disproven.
  - Data sources: DNS resolver logs, Passive DNS
  - Suggested query: `dns | where query in ('www.johnsoncontrols.com','www.cisa.gov') | summarize count() by client_ip`
- **[H-edf239d6-2-O2] Egress connections to published C2 IPs** _(difficulty: medium · 200 pts · MITRE: T1071, T1573)_
  - Falsification criterion: If proxy / firewall egress logs show no connections to the IOC IPs or matching ASNs, network-level C2 is unsupported.
  - Data sources: Proxy logs, NetFlow, Firewall accept logs
  - Suggested query: `egress | where dst_ip in ('the published C2 IPs') | summarize bytes_out = sum(bytes_sent) by src_ip`
- **[H-edf239d6-2-O3] Beacon periodicity / jitter analysis** _(difficulty: hard · 300 pts · MITRE: T1071, T1095)_
  - Falsification criterion: If beacon-style periodic outbound connections (low jitter, small payloads) to uncategorised destinations are absent, covert C2 is unlikely.
  - Data sources: NetFlow, Zeek conn.log
  - Suggested query: `conn | summarize stddev_interval = stdev(diff(ts)), count() by src_ip, dst_host | where count() > 50 and stddev_interval < 5s`
- **[H-edf239d6-2-O4] TLS / JA3 fingerprint pivot** _(difficulty: hard · 250 pts · MITRE: T1573.002)_
  - Falsification criterion: If JA3/JA3S fingerprints associated with the reported family are absent in TLS telemetry, encrypted C2 attribution is weakened.
  - Data sources: Zeek ssl.log, Suricata TLS, NDR
  - Suggested query: `tls | where ja3 in (ti_lookup('family','ja3')) | summarize by src_ip, sni`
- **[H-edf239d6-2-O5] Remote-monitoring tooling abuse check** _(difficulty: medium · 200 pts · MITRE: T1219)_
  - Falsification criterion: If unmanaged AnyDesk / TeamViewer / ScreenConnect / Atera installs are absent, RMM-based C2 is disproven.
  - Data sources: EDR installed-software, Process telemetry
  - Suggested query: `process | where name in ('anydesk.exe','teamviewer.exe','screenconnect.exe','atera*.exe') and signer != 'corp_managed'`

#### H-edf239d6-3 · Identity compromise of privileged users  _(confidence: medium)_

**Statement.** Privileged identities have been compromised through phishing, MFA fatigue, help-desk social engineering, or OAuth illicit-consent grants.

**Why this hypothesis?** Archetype 'identity_compromise' selected based on CVEs cited: CVE-2026-64892; vectors: exploit.

**MITRE ATT&CK**: T1078, T1621, T1528, T1556

**CTF objectives (4) — find evidence that disproves the hypothesis:**

- **[H-edf239d6-3-O1] Impossible-travel / atypical sign-ins** _(difficulty: easy · 100 pts · MITRE: T1078.004)_
  - Falsification criterion: If Entra ID / Okta risky-sign-in detections show no impossible-travel hits on privileged identities, account compromise is unsupported.
  - Data sources: Entra ID sign-in logs, Okta system log
  - Suggested query: `signin | where risk_level in ('high','medium') and user in (privileged_users) | summarize by country, ip`
- **[H-edf239d6-3-O2] MFA-fatigue / push-bombing** _(difficulty: medium · 200 pts · MITRE: T1621, T1078)_
  - Falsification criterion: If MFA telemetry shows no bursts of denied pushes followed by a successful one for the same user, MFA-fatigue compromise is disproven.
  - Data sources: MFA provider logs (Duo / Entra)
  - Suggested query: `mfa | summarize denies = countif(result=='deny'), accepts = countif(result=='accept') by user, bin(ts,1h) | where denies > 5 and accepts > 0`
- **[H-edf239d6-3-O3] Help-desk social-engineering pivot** _(difficulty: hard · 250 pts · MITRE: T1078, T1556)_
  - Falsification criterion: If ticketing / call-recording shows no recent password-reset or MFA-reset requests for privileged users without proper verification, help-desk vector is unsupported.
  - Data sources: ITSM ticket data, Help-desk recordings
  - Suggested query: `tickets | where action in ('password_reset','mfa_reset') and target in (privileged_users) | join (verifications) on ticket_id`
- **[H-edf239d6-3-O4] OAuth illicit-consent grants** _(difficulty: medium · 200 pts · MITRE: T1528)_
  - Falsification criterion: If Entra/Workspace audit logs show no recently consented third-party apps with high-impact scopes, OAuth abuse is disproven.
  - Data sources: Entra ID audit log, Google Workspace audit
  - Suggested query: `audit | where action == 'Consent to application' and scopes contains 'Mail.Read' or 'files.read.all'`
