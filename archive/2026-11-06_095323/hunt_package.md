  - Data sources: NetFlow, Zeek conn.log
  - Suggested query: `conn | summarize stddev_interval = stdev(diff(ts)), count() by src_ip, dst_host | where count() > 50 and stddev_interval < 5s`
- **[H-241eceff-2-O4] TLS / JA3 fingerprint pivot** _(difficulty: hard · 250 pts · MITRE: T1573.002)_
  - Falsification criterion: If JA3/JA3S fingerprints associated with the reported family are absent in TLS telemetry, encrypted C2 attribution is weakened.
  - Data sources: Zeek ssl.log, Suricata TLS, NDR
  - Suggested query: `tls | where ja3 in (ti_lookup('family','ja3')) | summarize by src_ip, sni`
- **[H-241eceff-2-O5] Remote-monitoring tooling abuse check** _(difficulty: medium · 200 pts · MITRE: T1219)_
  - Falsification criterion: If unmanaged AnyDesk / TeamViewer / ScreenConnect / Atera installs are absent, RMM-based C2 is disproven.
  - Data sources: EDR installed-software, Process telemetry
  - Suggested query: `process | where name in ('anydesk.exe','teamviewer.exe','screenconnect.exe','atera*.exe') and signer != 'corp_managed'`

#### H-241eceff-3 · Identity compromise of privileged users  _(confidence: medium)_

**Statement.** Privileged identities have been compromised through phishing, MFA fatigue, help-desk social engineering, or OAuth illicit-consent grants.

**Why this hypothesis?** Archetype 'identity_compromise' selected based on CVEs cited: CVE-2026-86950, CVE-2026-86990, CVE-2026-28864; vectors: exploit, smb.

**MITRE ATT&CK**: T1078, T1621, T1528, T1556

- **[H-241eceff-3-O1] Impossible-travel / atypical sign-ins** _(difficulty: easy · 100 pts · MITRE: T1078.004)_
  - Falsification criterion: If Entra ID / Okta risky-sign-in detections show no impossible-travel hits on privileged identities, account compromise is unsupported.
  - Data sources: Entra ID sign-in logs, Okta system log
  - Suggested query: `signin | where risk_level in ('high','medium') and user in (privileged_users) | summarize by country, ip`
- **[H-241eceff-3-O2] MFA-fatigue / push-bombing** _(difficulty: medium · 200 pts · MITRE: T1621, T1078)_
  - Falsification criterion: If MFA telemetry shows no bursts of denied pushes followed by a successful one for the same user, MFA-fatigue compromise is disproven.
  - Data sources: MFA provider logs (Duo / Entra)
  - Suggested query: `mfa | summarize denies = countif(result=='deny'), accepts = countif(result=='accept') by user, bin(ts,1h) | where denies > 5 and accepts > 0`
- **[H-241eceff-3-O3] Help-desk social-engineering pivot** _(difficulty: hard · 250 pts · MITRE: T1078, T1556)_
  - Falsification criterion: If ticketing / call-recording shows no recent password-reset or MFA-reset requests for privileged users without proper verification, help-desk vector is unsupported.
  - Data sources: ITSM ticket data, Help-desk recordings
  - Suggested query: `tickets | where action in ('password_reset','mfa_reset') and target in (privileged_users) | join (verifications) on ticket_id`
- **[H-241eceff-3-O4] OAuth illicit-consent grants** _(difficulty: medium · 200 pts · MITRE: T1528)_
  - Falsification criterion: If Entra/Workspace audit logs show no recently consented third-party apps with high-impact scopes, OAuth abuse is disproven.

> Patching PHP fixes PHP2Shell (CVE-2026-109618 / 109619), but it does nothing about a backdoor someone planted before the patch. Amazon's honeypots caught an exploitation attempt on Oct 17, four days before disclosure, and Amazon's advice is to investigate from at least that date. So I used Claude Code to spin up a bash script to triage WordPress sites. It checks: * PHP CLI version vs. the fixed releases * Core and plugin checksums (via WP-CLI) * PHP files in uploads * Files modified since Oct 17 (adjustable) * auto_prepend_file hooks in .user.ini / .htaccess / php.ini * mu-plugins * Common web-shell patterns in wp-content * Admin accounts and any users created in the window * Injected scripts in options and posts * WP-Cron, the site user's crontab, and SSH authorized_keys It's read-only and never modifies or deletes anything. It runs WP-CLI with --skip-plugins --skip-themes so a backdoored plugin can't execute during the check. It works on one site, every site on a server, or a list of remote servers over SSH, and it writes a Markdown report per site plus a summary. Repo (MIT): https://github.com/brentmartinmiller/php2shell-check Caveats: a clean report lowers the odds of compromise but doesn't prove a site is clean. It doesn't parse web server logs, so pull those separately before rotation eats the Oct 17+ window. A few false positives are expected, like Wordfence's prepend file, header-script plugins, and obfuscated premium plugins. The README covers how to read them. I'd a

> CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog , based on evidence of active exploitation. CVE-2026-111357 Ivanti Connect Secure Missing Authentication for Critical Function Vulnerability CVE-2026-97229 GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition Integer Overflow or Wraparound vulnerability These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-04: Prioritizing Security Updates Based on Risk establishes vulnerability management requirements for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. BOD 26-04 reinforces the importance of the KEV Catalog and requires federal agencies to prioritize rapid remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities, specifically those identified by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) listed in CISA’s KEV Catalog on publicly exposed assets that grant total control of the asset post-exploitation, while deferring action for lower-risk vulnerabilities. BOD 26-04 further establishes basic expectations for when agencies must check whether threat actors compromised the system before the patch was applied. While BOD 26-04 applies only to FCEB agencies, CISA encourages all organizations to adopt risk-based vulnerability management and prioritize remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities . CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria . Awa

> CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog , based on evidence of active exploitation. CVE-2026-111357 Ivanti Connect Secure Missing Authentication for Critical Function Vulnerability CVE-2026-118527 Ivanti Connect Secure Generation of Predictable Numbers or Identifiers Vulnerability These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-04: Prioritizing Security Updates Based on Risk establishes vulnerability management requirements for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. BOD 26-04 reinforces the importance of the KEV Catalog and requires federal agencies to prioritize rapid remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities, specifically those identified by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) listed in CISA’s KEV Catalog on publicly exposed assets that grant total control of the asset post-exploitation, while deferring action for lower-risk vulnerabilities. BOD 26-04 further establishes basic expectations for when agencies must check whether threat actors compromised the system before the patch was applied. While BOD 26-04 applies only to FCEB agencies, CISA encourages all organizations to adopt risk-based vulnerability management and prioritize remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities . CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria . Aware of a

> One of the early web application vulnerabilities I remember was CVE-2000-0411 [CVE]. This was a simple vulnerability in a CGI-bin script used to send e-mail. The vulnerability was pretty straightforward: Adding additional parameters to the URL leaked environment variables. Other vulnerabilities allowed setting the "To" address and were heavily abused by spammers. And if parameters were passed directly to the sendmail binary, similar vulnerabilities could allow arbitrary code execution.

> CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog , based on evidence of active exploitation. CVE-2026-41709 Broadcom VMWare ESX Insufficient Logging Vulnerability CVE-2026-46300 Linux Kernel Missing Initialization of a Variable Vulnerability These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-04: Prioritizing Security Updates Based on Risk establishes vulnerability management requirements for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. BOD 26-04 reinforces the importance of the KEV Catalog and requires federal agencies to prioritize rapid remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities, specifically those identified by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) listed in CISA’s KEV Catalog on publicly exposed assets that grant total control of the asset post-exploitation, while deferring action for lower-risk vulnerabilities. BOD 26-04 further establishes basic expectations for when agencies must check whether threat actors compromised the system before the patch was applied. While BOD 26-04 applies only to FCEB agencies, CISA encourages all organizations to adopt risk-based vulnerability management and prioritize remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities . CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria . Aware of an exploited vulnerability not currently listed in

- **Score rationale**: source weight (advisory)=+15, 2 CVE(s)=+25, 1 initial-access vector(s)=+7

> CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog , based on evidence of active exploitation. CVE-2026-48356 Adobe Commerce and Magento Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type Vulnerability CVE-2026-111497 Google Brotli Unchecked Return Value Vulnerability These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-04: Prioritizing Security Updates Based on Risk establishes vulnerability management requirements for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. BOD 26-04 reinforces the importance of the KEV Catalog and requires federal agencies to prioritize rapid remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities, specifically those identified by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) listed in CISA’s KEV Catalog on publicly exposed assets that grant total control of the asset post-exploitation, while deferring action for lower-risk vulnerabilities. BOD 26-04 further establishes basic expectations for when agencies must check whether threat actors compromised the system before the patch was applied. While BOD 26-04 applies only to FCEB agencies, CISA encourages all organizations to adopt risk-based vulnerability management and prioritize remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities . CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria . Aware of an exploited vulnerability n

> Our Threat Research Unit published a breakdown of “The Gentlemen” - a Russian-speaking ransomware-as-a-service group that emerged in mid-2025, reportedly after affiliates split off from established groups like LockBit and Qilin. A few things that stood out from the research: They’re offering affiliates up to 90% of ransom revenue - aggressive even by RaaS standards Claimed 800+ victims across the US and Europe, making them one of the top RaaS groups this year Cross-platform ransomware variants targeting Windows, Linux, NAS, and BSD Active use of EDR-killing tooling - one recent incident involved a custom dropper abusing vulnerable Safetica ProcessMonitor and Lenovo BootRepair.sys drivers (BYOVD) A breach of the group’s own infrastructure gave researchers rare visibility into their affiliate network, tooling, and ties to the broader ransomware ecosystem Full technical writeup linked below for anyone who wants to dig into the IOCs and affiliate details. https://www.acronis.com/en/tru/posts/the-gentlemen-a-closer-look-at-a-not-so-gentle-ransomware-as-a-service-operation/ submitted by /u/acronis [link] [comments]

> CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog and updated the PHP Alert, Critical Vulnerabilities in PHP Require Immediate Patching : CVE-2026-109618 – PHP Memory Corruption Vulnerability CVE-2026-109619 – PHP Stale Internal Request-State Vulnerability These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-04: Prioritizing Security Updates Based on Risk establishes vulnerability management requirements for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. BOD 26-04 reinforces the importance of the KEV Catalog and requires federal agencies to prioritize rapid remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities, specifically those identified by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) listed in CISA’s KEV Catalog on publicly exposed assets that grant total control of the asset post-exploitation, while deferring action for lower-risk vulnerabilities. BOD 26-04 further establishes basic expectations for when agencies must check whether threat actors compromised the system before the patch was applied. While BOD 26-04 applies only to FCEB agencies, CISA encourages all organizations to adopt risk-based vulnerability management and prioritize remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities . CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria . Aware of an exploited vulnerability not curre

> Overview The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Health and Human Services (HHS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Department of Transportation (DoT)—hereafter referred to as “the authoring organizations”—are aware of malicious cyber activity targeting industrial refrigeration and cold chain monitoring systems globally. Organizations in the Healthcare and Public Health , Chemical , Food and Agriculture , and Transportation Systems Sectors widely use these systems, including in refrigerated transport services, for automated and remote monitoring of temperatures, continuous temperature logging, defrost cycle management, and energy optimization. The authoring organizations urge owners and operators to defend against this activity by using strong authentication, keeping systems updated, identifying any systems that are accessible from the internet, removing unnecessary remote access, and securing any necessary remote access. Threat The authoring organizations are aware of malicious cyber actors targeting electronic temperature controllers and commercial refrigeration controllers in retail grocery and cold storage facilities. The actors may exploit vulnerabilities or weaknesses in unpatched or internet-accessible controllers to remotely alter settings and force units into continuous heating and defrost cycles, which can cause widespread inventory loss and equipment hazards. Specifically, the actors may explo

> CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog , based on evidence of active exploitation. CVE-2024-27834 Apple Multiple Products Improper Authentication Vulnerability This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and poses significant risks to the federal enterprise. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-04: Prioritizing Security Updates Based on Risk establishes vulnerability management requirements for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. BOD 26-04 reinforces the importance of the KEV Catalog and requires federal agencies to prioritize rapid remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities, specifically those identified by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) listed in CISA’s KEV Catalog on publicly exposed assets that grant total control of the asset post-exploitation, while deferring action for lower-risk vulnerabilities. BOD 26-04 further establishes basic expectations for when agencies must check whether threat actors compromised the system before the patch was applied. While BOD 26-04 applies only to FCEB agencies, CISA encourages all organizations to adopt risk-based vulnerability management and prioritize remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities . CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria . Aware of an exploited vulnerability not currently listed in the KEV Catalog? Submit it for potential addition through CISA’s KEV Nominati

> CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog , based on evidence of active exploitation. CVE-2026-110447 Collabora Online – Built-in CODE Server OS Command Injection Vulnerability This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and poses significant risks to the federal enterprise. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-04: Prioritizing Security Updates Based on Risk establishes vulnerability management requirements for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. BOD 26-04 reinforces the importance of the KEV Catalog and requires federal agencies to prioritize rapid remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities, specifically those identified by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) listed in CISA’s KEV Catalog on publicly exposed assets that grant total control of the asset post-exploitation, while deferring action for lower-risk vulnerabilities. BOD 26-04 further establishes basic expectations for when agencies must check whether threat actors compromised the system before the patch was applied. While BOD 26-04 applies only to FCEB agencies, CISA encourages all organizations to adopt risk-based vulnerability management and prioritize remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities . CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria . Aware of an exploited vulnerability not currently listed in the KEV Catalog? Submit it for potential addition through CISA’

> For defenders: on the open internet php2shell is landing shells on honeypots and sensors, not production hosts, as of now. The confirmed production impact is on internet-facing Palo Alto PAN-OS management interfaces, around 25 rooted. If your PAN-OS management plane is internet-reachable, that is the priority. The post includes the open-directory IOCs we recovered (panos_rce_poc.py, prce.py , a shared ASLR-bypass kit, host list) and detection guidance. The escalation to root uses Fragnesia (CVE-2026-46300), so patch state on both the PHP side and the kernel side matters. submitted by /u/Straight-Practice-99 [link] [comments]
