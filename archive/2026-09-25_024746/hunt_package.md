> At the end of August, a malspam message was caught in the quarantine of a mail gateway operated by one of my customers. The message was not especially remarkable â;€;“; it asked the recipient to review some attached requirements and provide a price quotation for a fiber optic system and appeared to impersonate an employee of a legitimate company. ; ; The receiving gateway quarantined the message because it detected malicious content in the attachment, though even if it didnâ;€;™t, the e-mail would not have gotten much further due to failed SPF and DMARC checks. ;

> CISA has added three new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog , based on evidence of active exploitation. CVE-2026-42016 JFrog Artifactory Incorrect Authorization Vulnerability CVE-2026-42018 JFrog Artifactory Improper Authentication Vulnerability CVE-2026-84869 ConnectWise ScreenConnect Improper Privilege Management and Missing Authorization Vulnerability These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-04: Prioritizing Security Updates Based on Risk establishes vulnerability management requirements for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. BOD 26-04 reinforces the importance of the KEV Catalog and requires federal agencies to prioritize rapid remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities, specifically those identified by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) listed in CISA’s KEV Catalog on publicly exposed assets that grant total control of the asset post-exploitation, while deferring action for lower-risk vulnerabilities. BOD 26-04 further establishes basic expectations for when agencies must check whether threat actors compromised the system before the patch was applied. While BOD 26-04 applies only to FCEB agencies, CISA encourages all organizations to adopt risk-based vulnerability management and prioritize remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities . CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to

> Business Email Compromise (BEC) operates on a familiar playbook. Threat actors breach a mailbox, silently monitor operations, map approval chains, and ultimately exploit that access to divert funds or exfiltrate sensitive assets. This dynamic is central to our analysis as we kick off a series around Rapid7's collaborative research with Zimbra; upcoming installments will explore technical details and broader findings based within the Zimbra Collaboration Suite. Our investigation disrupted the traditional BEC model in unexpected ways. We uncovered over 50 vulnerabilities, and found that several allow attackers not just to observe environments, but to actively rewrite them by impersonating senders without credentials, controlling inbox visibility, and altering shared documents and calendars. Business Email Compromise in action: Digital abuse of trust None of this is theoretical for Zimbra. But don’t take my word for it, just ask Russia . CISA keeps putting Zimbra bugs into the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog , and the last three years make the point on their own: CVE-2024-45519 , command injection in the postjournal service, unauthenticated command execution. Proofpoint saw attackers stuffing base64 payloads into CC fields on September 28, 2024. CISA added it to KEV on October 3. CVE-2025-27915 , stored XSS in the Classic Web Client, triggered by a crafted .ICS attachment. It is used as a zero-day against Brazilian military targets to steal mail and quietly set forwardin

> View CSAF Summary A Client Code Execution (CCE) vulnerability has been identified in Desigo CC, potentially allowing malicious actors to execute arbitrary code on client devices through specially crafted graphics documents. This vulnerability leverages user-defined graphics containing embedded scripts that are executed on client application instances. Successful exploitation could lead to compromise of the client operating system and potential lateral movement within the organization. The following versions of Siemens Desigo CC family are affected: Desigo CC family V6 vers:all/* (CVE-2026-34223) Desigo CC family V7 vers:all/* (CVE-2026-34223) CVSS Vendor Equipment Vulnerabilities v3 8.2 Siemens Siemens Desigo CC family Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') Background Critical Infrastructure Sectors: Critical Manufacturing, Commercial Facilities Countries/Areas Deployed: Worldwide Company Headquarters Location: Germany Vulnerabilities Expand All + CVE-2026-34223 The affected application is vulnerable to Client Code Execution (CCE) due to insufficient input validation when handling scripts embedded within user-defined graphics documents. Specifically, when the script within a graphics document is designed or modified by an attacker to include malicious commands. When a user opens a compromised graphics document, the embedded script is executed on the client application instance, allowing an attacker to write arbitrary files to the client's operating system.

CVE-2026-76460 Cisco Identity Services Engine Incorrect Use of Privileged APIs Vulnerability CVE-2026-87886 Acronis Backup Incorrect Default Permissions Vulnerability These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-04: Prioritizing Security Updates Based on Risk establishes vulnerability management requirements for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. BOD 26-04 reinforces the importance of the KEV Catalog and requires federal agencies to prioritize rapid remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities, specifically those identified by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) listed in CISA’s KEV Catalog on publicly exposed assets that grant total control of the asset post-exploitation, while deferring action for lower-risk vulnerabilities. BOD 26-04 further establishes basic expectations for when agencies must check whether threat actors compromised the system before the patch was applied. While BOD 26-04 applies only to FCEB agencies, CISA encourages all organizations to adopt risk-based vulnerability management and prioritize remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities .

> Overview On September 14, 2026, Cisco published a security advisory for CVE-2026-76461 , a critical SQL injection vulnerability affecting Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Secure Email Gateway. The vulnerability has a reported CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 and could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on an affected appliance. Cisco Secure Email Gateway, formerly known as IronPort Email Security Appliance, is an enterprise email security product that inspects inbound and outbound email for threats including phishing, malware, spam, and business email compromise. Because affected gateways process externally delivered email as part of their normal operation, exploitation does not require access to an administrative interface or authentication. An attacker can reportedly trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted email through a vulnerable gateway. CVE-2026-76461 was added to CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog on the same day as the vendor disclosed the vulnerability, indicating that CVE-2026-76461 was exploited as a zero-day prior to disclosure. Cisco noted that their PSIRT became aware of active exploitation in September 2026. At the time of publication, there is no public proof-of-concept exploit code available, and no attribution for the current threat actor activity. Mitigation guidance Organizations running Cisco Secure Email Gateway should prioritize upgrading to a vendor-supplied fixe

> Overview On September 22, 2026, F5 published a security advisory for CVE-2026-94127 , a critical heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability affecting F5 BIG-IP Access Policy Manager (APM). The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8. An unauthenticated attacker with network access to an affected virtual server may be able to achieve remote code execution (RCE) by sending specifically crafted traffic. BIG-IP APM provides identity-aware access control for applications and other corporate resources and can integrate with authentication technologies including OAuth, OpenID Connect, and SAML. CVE-2026-94127 is not exposed in a default configuration: exploitation requires a BIG-IP virtual server with both an APM access policy and an OAuth profile configured. Because affected BIG-IP systems may process traffic at an organization's network edge, organizations using this configuration should prioritize remediation. The vulnerability affects the data plane and does not expose the BIG-IP control plane. BIG-IP systems operating in Appliance mode are also affected. F5 lists the following affected release trains and corresponding fixed hotfixes: BIG-IP 21.1.0: versions prior to Hotfix-BIGIP-21.1.0.2.0.30.22-ENG BIG-IP 17.5.0: versions prior to Hotfix-BIGIP-17.5.1.9.0.160.12-ENG BIG-IP 17.1.0: versions prior to Hotfix-BIGIP-17.1.3.5.0.41.14-ENG As of September 22, 2026, CVE-2026-94127 has been added to the CISA KEV while a publicly available proof of concept was not confirmed.

> Introduction The surge in emerging threat actors directly correlates with the rapid escalation of victim counts and stolen financial resources. Simultaneously, this growth has spurred the proliferation of specialized supply storefronts across social media platforms, dark web channels, and various smaller niche marketplaces. Security teams today face evolving challenges, requiring them to continuously refine monitoring channels, adjust operational strategies, and foster cross-functional internal collaboration to capture actionable intelligence. With fraud damages anticipated to approach hundreds of billions of USD , security teams must navigate numerous non-compliant channels while ingesting and processing diverse data formats—such as documents, imagery, video, and unformatted text—linked to organizational assets. The recent introduction of a new Fraud framework by the MITRE organization underscores the critical need to combat fraud and highlights the significant danger these threat actors pose to all organizations. The MITRE organization has been taking a positive step towards standardizing the fight against fraud, while helping organizations target the relevant directions to look at. These marketplaces supply a range of services in need for the novice fraudster, encompassing server infrastructure, targeted lists, and even support for money laundering facilitated through compromised accounts across various platforms. As larger, well-known marketplaces have been dismantled, sm

> CISA has added four new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog , based on evidence of active exploitation. CVE-2026-85102 Check Point Multiple Products Improper Certificate Validation Vulnerability CVE-2026-93616 Check Point Multiple Products Path Traversal Vulnerability CVE-2026-93952 Arista VeloCloud Orchestrator Improper Input Validation Vulnerability CVE-2026-94127 F5 BIG-IP APM Heap-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-04: Prioritizing Security Updates Based on Risk establishes vulnerability management requirements for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. BOD 26-04 reinforces the importance of the KEV Catalog and requires federal agencies to prioritize rapid remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities, specifically those identified by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) listed in CISA’s KEV Catalog on publicly exposed assets that grant total control of the asset post-exploitation, while deferring action for lower-risk vulnerabilities. BOD 26-04 further establishes basic expectations for when agencies must check whether threat actors compromised the system before the patch was applied. While BOD 26-04 applies only to FCEB agencies, CISA encourages all organizations to adopt risk-based vulnerability management and prioritize remediation of KEV Catal

CVE-2025-39964 Linux Kernel Race Condition Vulnerability CVE-2026-53266 Linux Kernel Out-of-Bounds Write Vulnerability These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-04: Prioritizing Security Updates Based on Risk establishes vulnerability management requirements for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. BOD 26-04 reinforces the importance of the KEV Catalog and requires federal agencies to prioritize rapid remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities, specifically those identified by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) listed in CISA’s KEV Catalog on publicly exposed assets that grant total control of the asset post-exploitation, while deferring action for lower-risk vulnerabilities. BOD 26-04 further establishes basic expectations for when agencies must check whether threat actors compromised the system before the patch was applied. While BOD 26-04 applies only to FCEB agencies, CISA encourages all organizations to adopt risk-based vulnerability management and prioritize remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities . CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria . Aware of an exploited vulnerability not currently listed in the KEV Catalog? Submit it fo

> Overview On September 10, 2026, GitLab published a critical patch release for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE). The release addresses CVE-2026-85706 , a critical path traversal vulnerability ( CWE-22 ) in the repository commits API with a CVSSv3.1 score of 10.0 . According to GitLab, improper path confinement and missing authentication enforcement could allow an unauthenticated user to read arbitrary files from an affected GitLab server under certain conditions. On September 11, 2026, CVE-2026-85706 was added to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA) Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. CISA set a remediation due date of September 14, 2026, for affected Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies and marked the vulnerability as subject to forensic triage requirements under Binding Operational Directive 26-04. Organizations running affected self-managed GitLab instances should remediate CVE-2026-85706 on an emergency basis, outside of normal patch cycles. Mitigation guidance A vendor-supplied update is available to remediate CVE-2026-85706. Organizations running affected self-managed GitLab CE or EE instances should upgrade to a fixed version immediately. Affected GitLab CE/EE versions Fixed version All versions from 18.7 before 19.1.8 19.1.8 All versions from 19.2 before 19.2.6 19.2.6 All versions from 19.3 before 19.3.2 19.3.2 GitLab.com is already running a patched versio

> CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog , based on evidence of active exploitation. CVE-2026-5430 WSO2 Multiple Products Path Traversal Vulnerability CVE-2026-71362 Adobe Commerce and Magento Incorrect Authorization Vulnerability These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-04: Prioritizing Security Updates Based on Risk establishes vulnerability management requirements for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. BOD 26-04 reinforces the importance of the KEV Catalog and requires federal agencies to prioritize rapid remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities, specifically those identified by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) listed in CISA’s KEV Catalog on publicly exposed assets that grant total control of the asset post-exploitation, while deferring action for lower-risk vulnerabilities. BOD 26-04 further establishes basic expectations for when agencies must check whether threat actors compromised the system before the patch was applied. While BOD 26-04 applies only to FCEB agencies, CISA encourages all organizations to adopt risk-based vulnerability management and prioritize remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities . CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria . Aware of an exploited vulnerability not currently listed in th
