> The PRC-aligned actor tracked as Volt Typhoon is exploiting an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Fortinet FortiGate appliances (CVE-2024-21762) to compromise edge devices and pivot into operational technology networks. Mandiant observed living-off-the-land lateral movement, credential dumping from LSASS, and the deployment of webshells on the VPN appliance. C2 traffic was observed to 185.225.74.10 and the domain login-portal-update.com. SHA256 of the dropped beacon: 3b8e7d9c2f1a0b6d4e5f9a8b7c6d5e4f3a2b1c0d9e8f7a6b5c4d3e2f1a0b9c8d.

> CISA and partners warn that Akira ransomware affiliates continue to gain initial access via Cisco ASA SSL VPN portals where MFA is not enforced, often using credentials obtained from RedLine and Lumma Stealer logs. Lateral movement is conducted with RDP and PsExec, followed by data exfiltration via Rclone to mega.nz and encryption of ESXi datastores. Manufacturing and healthcare sectors are heavily targeted. IOC IPs include 45.61.136.215 and 193.143.1.205.
