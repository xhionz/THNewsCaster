> Advisory at a Glance Title #StopRansomware: SafePay Ransomware Original Publication October 20, 2026 Executive Summary This advisory details recent activity by the SafePay ransomware group. SafePay actors have been highly active since August 2024, targeting businesses and critical infrastructure across North America, South America, Europe, and Australia. SafePay actors typically gain access to networks by stealing or guessing passwords, exploiting vulnerabilities in security systems, and using phishing tactics. Once inside the network, SafePay actors establish control by creating new accounts or taking over existing ones. They then use legitimate system tools to move through the network, identify valuable files, and disable security protections to avoid detection. Following, they encrypt the victim’s files, making them inaccessible, and leave a ransom note demanding payment in cryptocurrency. This advisory urges organizations to follow recommended security measures to reduce the risk and impact of SafePay ransomware attacks.

A request whose path segment is not exact-lowercase (for example /IDDASH2ARK/...) enters the location (the matcher fires) but evades the rewrite (no redirect is issued), so nginx falls through to the location's proxy_pass to the Arkime backend. That location is the one proxied location in the shipped config that does not include the per-location authentication file, so the request reaches Arkime unauthenticated. The same location also forwards a client-supplied X-Forwarded-User header un-overwritten, and Arkime is configured to trust X-Forwarded-User as the authenticated username — so an unauthenticated network caller can reach the Arkime backend while supplying a forged, auto-provisioned identity.

### Hypotheses (3)

#### H-241eceff-1 · Initial access via CVE-2026-86950 affecting the affected product/service  _(confidence: medium)_

**Statement.** A threat actor has attempted to obtain initial access to our environment by exploiting CVE-2026-86950 in the affected product/service within the last 30 days.

**Why this hypothesis?** Archetype 'initial_access_cve' selected based on CVEs cited: CVE-2026-86950, CVE-2026-86990, CVE-2026-28864; vectors: exploit, smb.

**MITRE ATT&CK**: T1190, T1133

**CTF objectives (5) — find evidence that disproves the hypothesis:**

- **[H-241eceff-1-O1] Inventory exposure to the affected product** _(difficulty: easy · 100 pts · MITRE: T1190)_
  - Falsification criterion: If zero internet-facing assets run a vulnerable build of the affected product, the external-exploitation hypothesis is disproven for CVE-2026-86950.
  - Data sources: Asset CMDB, External attack-surface scanner, Vulnerability scanner
  - Suggested query: `asset_inventory | where product == 'the affected product' and exposure == 'internet' and version in (vulnerable_versions)`
- **[H-241eceff-1-O2] Hunt for exploit attempts at the edge** _(difficulty: medium · 200 pts · MITRE: T1190, T1133)_
  - Falsification criterion: If WAF / firewall / IDS show no exploit-signature hits for CVE-2026-86950 in the last 30 days, in-the-wild exploitation against us is unsupported.
  - Data sources: WAF logs, IDS/IPS, Edge firewall, CDN logs
  - Suggested query: `edge_logs | where signature contains 'CVE' or uri matches /exploit-pattern-for-CVE-2026-86950/ | summarize count() by src_ip, dst_host`
- **[H-241eceff-1-O3] Patch-status correlation** _(difficulty: easy · 100 pts · MITRE: T1190)_
  - Falsification criterion: If MDM / patch-management shows 100% deployment of the CVE-2026-86950 fix across exposed hosts, the hypothesis is disproven by remediation.
  - Data sources: SCCM/Intune, Patch management, Tanium / Kandji
  - Suggested query: `patch_state | where kb in (fixes_for('CVE-2026-86950')) | summarize coverage = avg(installed) by host_role`
- **[H-241eceff-1-O4] Post-exploit web-shell sweep** _(difficulty: medium · 250 pts · MITRE: T1505.003, T1059)_
  - Falsification criterion: If a sweep of webroots and IIS/Apache process trees finds no anomalous children (cmd, powershell, /bin/sh) on the affected product hosts, post-exploit foothold is unsupported.
  - Data sources: EDR process telemetry, File integrity monitoring
  - Suggested query: `process | where parent in ('w3wp.exe','httpd','nginx','java') and child in ('cmd.exe','powershell.exe','/bin/sh','/bin/bash')`
- **[H-241eceff-1-O5] Honeypot / canary check** _(difficulty: hard · 300 pts · MITRE: T1190)_
  - Falsification criterion: If exposed canary instances of the same product show no probing or exploitation telemetry, opportunistic mass-exploitation against the org is unlikely.
  - Data sources: Honeypot logs, Canary tokens
  - Suggested query: `canary_events | where product == '<product>' | where event_type in ('probe','exploit') | summarize by src_ip`

#### H-241eceff-2 · Outbound C2 beaconing to reported infrastructure  _(confidence: high)_

**Statement.** Hosts in the estate are beaconing to the command-and-control infrastructure reported in this article (domains, IPs, TLS fingerprints, or RMM tooling).

**Why this hypothesis?** Archetype 'c2_beacon' selected based on CVEs cited: CVE-2026-86950, CVE-2026-86990, CVE-2026-28864; vectors: exploit, smb.

**MITRE ATT&CK**: T1071, T1573, T1219

**CTF objectives (5) — find evidence that disproves the hypothesis:**

- **[H-241eceff-2-O1] DNS resolution sweep for published C2 domains** _(difficulty: easy · 100 pts · MITRE: T1071.004)_
  - Falsification criterion: If recursive DNS logs show zero resolutions for the IOC domains in the last 90 days, active beaconing is disproven.
  - Data sources: DNS resolver logs, Passive DNS
  - Suggested query: `dns | where query in ('isc.sans.edu') | summarize count() by client_ip`
- **[H-241eceff-2-O2] Egress connections to published C2 IPs** _(difficulty: medium · 200 pts · MITRE: T1071, T1573)_
  - Falsification criterion: If proxy / firewall egress logs show no connections to the IOC IPs or matching ASNs, network-level C2 is unsupported.
  - Data sources: Proxy logs, NetFlow, Firewall accept logs
  - Suggested query: `egress | where dst_ip in ('the published C2 IPs') | summarize bytes_out = sum(bytes_sent) by src_ip`
- **[H-241eceff-2-O3] Beacon periodicity / jitter analysis** _(difficulty: hard · 300 pts · MITRE: T1071, T1095)_
  - Falsification criterion: If beacon-style periodic outbound connections (low jitter, small payloads) to uncategorised destinations are absent, covert C2 is unlikely.
  - Data sources: NetFlow, Zeek conn.log
  - Suggested query: `conn | summarize stddev_interval = stdev(diff(ts)), count() by src_ip, dst_host | where count() > 50 and stddev_interval < 5s`
- **[H-241eceff-2-O4] TLS / JA3 fingerprint pivot** _(difficulty: hard · 250 pts · MITRE: T1573.002)_
  - Falsification criterion: If JA3/JA3S fingerprints associated with the reported family are absent in TLS telemetry, encrypted C2 attribution is weakened.
  - Data sources: Zeek ssl.log, Suricata TLS, NDR
  - Suggested query: `tls | where ja3 in (ti_lookup('family','ja3')) | summarize by src_ip, sni`
- **[H-241eceff-2-O5] Remote-monitoring tooling abuse check** _(difficulty: medium · 200 pts · MITRE: T1219)_
  - Falsification criterion: If unmanaged AnyDesk / TeamViewer / ScreenConnect / Atera installs are absent, RMM-based C2 is disproven.
  - Data sources: EDR installed-software, Process telemetry
  - Suggested query: `process | where name in ('anydesk.exe','teamviewer.exe','screenconnect.exe','atera*.exe') and signer != 'corp_managed'`

#### H-241eceff-3 · Identity compromise of privileged users  _(confidence: medium)_

**Statement.** Privileged identities have been compromised through phishing, MFA fatigue, help-desk social engineering, or OAuth illicit-consent grants.

**Why this hypothesis?** Archetype 'identity_compromise' selected based on CVEs cited: CVE-2026-86950, CVE-2026-86990, CVE-2026-28864; vectors: exploit, smb.

**MITRE ATT&CK**: T1078, T1621, T1528, T1556

**CTF objectives (4) — find evidence that disproves the hypothesis:**

- **[H-241eceff-3-O1] Impossible-travel / atypical sign-ins** _(difficulty: easy · 100 pts · MITRE: T1078.004)_
  - Falsification criterion: If Entra ID / Okta risky-sign-in detections show no impossible-travel hits on privileged identities, account compromise is unsupported.
  - Data sources: Entra ID sign-in logs, Okta system log
  - Suggested query: `signin | where risk_level in ('high','medium') and user in (privileged_users) | summarize by country, ip`
- **[H-241eceff-3-O2] MFA-fatigue / push-bombing** _(difficulty: medium · 200 pts · MITRE: T1621, T1078)_
  - Falsification criterion: If MFA telemetry shows no bursts of denied pushes followed by a successful one for the same user, MFA-fatigue compromise is disproven.
  - Data sources: MFA provider logs (Duo / Entra)
  - Suggested query: `mfa | summarize denies = countif(result=='deny'), accepts = countif(result=='accept') by user, bin(ts,1h) | where denies > 5 and accepts > 0`
- **[H-241eceff-3-O3] Help-desk social-engineering pivot** _(difficulty: hard · 250 pts · MITRE: T1078, T1556)_
  - Falsification criterion: If ticketing / call-recording shows no recent password-reset or MFA-reset requests for privileged users without proper verification, help-desk vector is unsupported.
  - Data sources: ITSM ticket data, Help-desk recordings
  - Suggested query: `tickets | where action in ('password_reset','mfa_reset') and target in (privileged_users) | join (verifications) on ticket_id`
- **[H-241eceff-3-O4] OAuth illicit-consent grants** _(difficulty: medium · 200 pts · MITRE: T1528)_
  - Falsification criterion: If Entra/Workspace audit logs show no recently consented third-party apps with high-impact scopes, OAuth abuse is disproven.
  - Data sources: Entra ID audit log, Google Workspace audit
  - Suggested query: `audit | where action == 'Consent to application' and scopes contains 'Mail.Read' or 'files.read.all'`

**Statement.** A threat actor has attempted to obtain initial access to our environment by exploiting CVE-2026-102073 in the affected product/service within the last 30 days.

**Why this hypothesis?** Archetype 'initial_access_cve' selected based on CVEs cited: CVE-2026-102073, CVE-2026-102074, CVE-2026-102075; vectors: exploit, vpn-edge; impact: ddos.

**MITRE ATT&CK**: T1190, T1133

**CTF objectives (5) — find evidence that disproves the hypothesis:**

- **[H-16e9c9c8-1-O1] Inventory exposure to the affected product** _(difficulty: easy · 100 pts · MITRE: T1190)_
  - Falsification criterion: If zero internet-facing assets run a vulnerable build of the affected product, the external-exploitation hypothesis is disproven for CVE-2026-102073.

- **[H-16e9c9c8-2-O1] DNS resolution sweep for published C2 domains** _(difficulty: easy · 100 pts · MITRE: T1071.004)_
  - Falsification criterion: If recursive DNS logs show zero resolutions for the IOC domains in the last 90 days, active beaconing is disproven.
  - Data sources: DNS resolver logs, Passive DNS
  - Suggested query: `dns | where query in ('www.siemens.com') | summarize count() by client_ip`
- **[H-16e9c9c8-2-O2] Egress connections to published C2 IPs** _(difficulty: medium · 200 pts · MITRE: T1071, T1573)_

  - Data sources: Proxy logs, NetFlow, Firewall accept logs
  - Suggested query: `egress | where dst_ip in ('the published C2 IPs') | summarize bytes_out = sum(bytes_sent) by src_ip`
- **[H-16e9c9c8-2-O3] Beacon periodicity / jitter analysis** _(difficulty: hard · 300 pts · MITRE: T1071, T1095)_
  - Falsification criterion: If beacon-style periodic outbound connections (low jitter, small payloads) to uncategorised destinations are absent, covert C2 is unlikely.
  - Data sources: NetFlow, Zeek conn.log
  - Suggested query: `conn | summarize stddev_interval = stdev(diff(ts)), count() by src_ip, dst_host | where count() > 50 and stddev_interval < 5s`
- **[H-16e9c9c8-2-O4] TLS / JA3 fingerprint pivot** _(difficulty: hard · 250 pts · MITRE: T1573.002)_
  - Falsification criterion: If JA3/JA3S fingerprints associated with the reported family are absent in TLS telemetry, encrypted C2 attribution is weakened.
  - Data sources: Zeek ssl.log, Suricata TLS, NDR
  - Suggested query: `tls | where ja3 in (ti_lookup('family','ja3')) | summarize by src_ip, sni`
- **[H-16e9c9c8-2-O5] Remote-monitoring tooling abuse check** _(difficulty: medium · 200 pts · MITRE: T1219)_
  - Falsification criterion: If unmanaged AnyDesk / TeamViewer / ScreenConnect / Atera installs are absent, RMM-based C2 is disproven.
  - Data sources: EDR installed-software, Process telemetry
  - Suggested query: `process | where name in ('anydesk.exe','teamviewer.exe','screenconnect.exe','atera*.exe') and signer != 'corp_managed'`

#### H-16e9c9c8-3 · Identity compromise of privileged users  _(confidence: medium)_

**Statement.** Privileged identities have been compromised through phishing, MFA fatigue, help-desk social engineering, or OAuth illicit-consent grants.

**Why this hypothesis?** Archetype 'identity_compromise' selected based on CVEs cited: CVE-2026-102073, CVE-2026-102074, CVE-2026-102075; vectors: exploit, vpn-edge; impact: ddos.

**MITRE ATT&CK**: T1078, T1621, T1528, T1556

**CTF objectives (4) — find evidence that disproves the hypothesis:**

- **[H-16e9c9c8-3-O1] Impossible-travel / atypical sign-ins** _(difficulty: easy · 100 pts · MITRE: T1078.004)_
  - Falsification criterion: If Entra ID / Okta risky-sign-in detections show no impossible-travel hits on privileged identities, account compromise is unsupported.
  - Data sources: Entra ID sign-in logs, Okta system log
  - Suggested query: `signin | where risk_level in ('high','medium') and user in (privileged_users) | summarize by country, ip`
- **[H-16e9c9c8-3-O2] MFA-fatigue / push-bombing** _(difficulty: medium · 200 pts · MITRE: T1621, T1078)_
  - Falsification criterion: If MFA telemetry shows no bursts of denied pushes followed by a successful one for the same user, MFA-fatigue compromise is disproven.
  - Data sources: MFA provider logs (Duo / Entra)
  - Suggested query: `mfa | summarize denies = countif(result=='deny'), accepts = countif(result=='accept') by user, bin(ts,1h) | where denies > 5 and accepts > 0`
- **[H-16e9c9c8-3-O3] Help-desk social-engineering pivot** _(difficulty: hard · 250 pts · MITRE: T1078, T1556)_
  - Falsification criterion: If ticketing / call-recording shows no recent password-reset or MFA-reset requests for privileged users without proper verification, help-desk vector is unsupported.
  - Data sources: ITSM ticket data, Help-desk recordings

> Patching PHP fixes PHP2Shell (CVE-2026-109618 / 109619), but it does nothing about a backdoor someone planted before the patch. Amazon's honeypots caught an exploitation attempt on Oct 17, four days before disclosure, and Amazon's advice is to investigate from at least that date. So I used Claude Code to spin up a bash script to triage WordPress sites. It checks: * PHP CLI version vs. the fixed releases * Core and plugin checksums (via WP-CLI) * PHP files in uploads * Files modified since Oct 17 (adjustable) * auto_prepend_file hooks in .user.ini / .htaccess / php.ini * mu-plugins * Common web-shell patterns in wp-content * Admin accounts and any users created in the window * Injected scripts in options and posts * WP-Cron, the site user's crontab, and SSH authorized_keys It's read-only and never modifies or deletes anything. It runs WP-CLI with --skip-plugins --skip-themes so a backdoored plugin can't execute during the check. It works on one site, every site on a server, or a list of remote servers over SSH, and it writes a Markdown report per site plus a summary. Repo (MIT): https://github.com/brentmartinmiller/php2shell-check Caveats: a clean report lowers the odds of compromise but doesn't prove a site is clean. It doesn't parse web server logs, so pull those separately before rotation eats the Oct 17+ window. A few false positives are expected, like Wordfence's prepend file, header-script plugins, and obfuscated premium plugins. The README covers how to read them. I'd a

### Hypotheses (3)

#### H-35d42093-1 · Initial access via CVE-2023-52927 affecting Linux kernel  _(confidence: high)_

**Statement.** A threat actor has attempted to obtain initial access to our environment by exploiting CVE-2023-52927 in Linux kernel within the last 30 days.

**Why this hypothesis?** Archetype 'initial_access_cve' selected based on CVEs cited: CVE-2023-52927, CVE-2023-53292, CVE-2023-54271; vectors: exploit, vpn-edge; products: Linux kernel.

**MITRE ATT&CK**: T1190, T1133

**CTF objectives (5) — find evidence that disproves the hypothesis:**

- **[H-35d42093-1-O1] Inventory exposure to Linux kernel** _(difficulty: easy · 100 pts · MITRE: T1190)_
  - Falsification criterion: If zero internet-facing assets run a vulnerable build of Linux kernel, the external-exploitation hypothesis is disproven for CVE-2023-52927.
  - Data sources: Asset CMDB, External attack-surface scanner, Vulnerability scanner
  - Suggested query: `asset_inventory | where product == 'Linux kernel' and exposure == 'internet' and version in (vulnerable_versions)`
- **[H-35d42093-1-O2] Hunt for exploit attempts at the edge** _(difficulty: medium · 200 pts · MITRE: T1190, T1133)_
  - Falsification criterion: If WAF / firewall / IDS show no exploit-signature hits for CVE-2023-52927 in the last 30 days, in-the-wild exploitation against us is unsupported.
  - Data sources: WAF logs, IDS/IPS, Edge firewall, CDN logs
  - Suggested query: `edge_logs | where signature contains 'CVE' or uri matches /exploit-pattern-for-CVE-2023-52927/ | summarize count() by src_ip, dst_host`
- **[H-35d42093-1-O3] Patch-status correlation** _(difficulty: easy · 100 pts · MITRE: T1190)_
  - Falsification criterion: If MDM / patch-management shows 100% deployment of the CVE-2023-52927 fix across exposed hosts, the hypothesis is disproven by remediation.
  - Data sources: SCCM/Intune, Patch management, Tanium / Kandji
  - Suggested query: `patch_state | where kb in (fixes_for('CVE-2023-52927')) | summarize coverage = avg(installed) by host_role`
- **[H-35d42093-1-O4] Post-exploit web-shell sweep** _(difficulty: medium · 250 pts · MITRE: T1505.003, T1059)_
  - Falsification criterion: If a sweep of webroots and IIS/Apache process trees finds no anomalous children (cmd, powershell, /bin/sh) on Linux kernel hosts, post-exploit foothold is unsupported.
  - Data sources: EDR process telemetry, File integrity monitoring
  - Suggested query: `process | where parent in ('w3wp.exe','httpd','nginx','java') and child in ('cmd.exe','powershell.exe','/bin/sh','/bin/bash')`
- **[H-35d42093-1-O5] Honeypot / canary check** _(difficulty: hard · 300 pts · MITRE: T1190)_
  - Falsification criterion: If exposed canary instances of the same product show no probing or exploitation telemetry, opportunistic mass-exploitation against the org is unlikely.
  - Data sources: Honeypot logs, Canary tokens
  - Suggested query: `canary_events | where product == '<product>' | where event_type in ('probe','exploit') | summarize by src_ip`

#### H-35d42093-2 · Outbound C2 beaconing to reported infrastructure  _(confidence: high)_

**Statement.** Hosts in the estate are beaconing to the command-and-control infrastructure reported in this article (domains, IPs, TLS fingerprints, or RMM tooling).

**Why this hypothesis?** Archetype 'c2_beacon' selected based on CVEs cited: CVE-2023-52927, CVE-2023-53292, CVE-2023-54271; vectors: exploit, vpn-edge; products: Linux kernel.

**MITRE ATT&CK**: T1071, T1573, T1219

**CTF objectives (5) — find evidence that disproves the hypothesis:**

- **[H-35d42093-2-O1] DNS resolution sweep for published C2 domains** _(difficulty: easy · 100 pts · MITRE: T1071.004)_
  - Falsification criterion: If recursive DNS logs show zero resolutions for the IOC domains in the last 90 days, active beaconing is disproven.
  - Data sources: DNS resolver logs, Passive DNS
  - Suggested query: `dns | where query in ('www.siemens.com') | summarize count() by client_ip`
- **[H-35d42093-2-O2] Egress connections to published C2 IPs** _(difficulty: medium · 200 pts · MITRE: T1071, T1573)_
  - Falsification criterion: If proxy / firewall egress logs show no connections to the IOC IPs or matching ASNs, network-level C2 is unsupported.
  - Data sources: Proxy logs, NetFlow, Firewall accept logs
  - Suggested query: `egress | where dst_ip in ('the published C2 IPs') | summarize bytes_out = sum(bytes_sent) by src_ip`
- **[H-35d42093-2-O3] Beacon periodicity / jitter analysis** _(difficulty: hard · 300 pts · MITRE: T1071, T1095)_

> CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog , based on evidence of active exploitation. CVE-2025-61624 Fortinet Multiple Products Path Traversal Vulnerability CVE-2026-102764 BeyondTrust Remote Support Authentication Bypass by Spoofing Vulnerability These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-04: Prioritizing Security Updates Based on Risk establishes vulnerability management requirements for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. BOD 26-04 reinforces the importance of the KEV Catalog and requires federal agencies to prioritize rapid remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities, specifically those identified by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) listed in CISA’s KEV Catalog on publicly exposed assets that grant total control of the asset post-exploitation, while deferring action for lower-risk vulnerabilities. BOD 26-04 further establishes basic expectations for when agencies must check whether threat actors compromised the system before the patch was applied. While BOD 26-04 applies only to FCEB agencies, CISA encourages all organizations to adopt risk-based vulnerability management and prioritize remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities . CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria . Aware of an exploited vulnerability not curren

> CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog , based on evidence of active exploitation. CVE-2026-41709 Broadcom VMWare ESX Insufficient Logging Vulnerability CVE-2026-46300 Linux Kernel Missing Initialization of a Variable Vulnerability These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-04: Prioritizing Security Updates Based on Risk establishes vulnerability management requirements for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. BOD 26-04 reinforces the importance of the KEV Catalog and requires federal agencies to prioritize rapid remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities, specifically those identified by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) listed in CISA’s KEV Catalog on publicly exposed assets that grant total control of the asset post-exploitation, while deferring action for lower-risk vulnerabilities. BOD 26-04 further establishes basic expectations for when agencies must check whether threat actors compromised the system before the patch was applied. While BOD 26-04 applies only to FCEB agencies, CISA encourages all organizations to adopt risk-based vulnerability management and prioritize remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities . CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria . Aware of an exploited vulnerability not currently listed in

> CISA is aware of critical authentication bypass vulnerability CVE-2026-102764 , affecting BeyondTrust Remote Support (formerly Bomgar) versions 26.2.3 and earlier. Patches are available for supported versions (24.3.1 and later); organizations using older versions must upgrade first. Cyber threat actors are actively exploiting the vulnerability to gain initial access, then establishing persistence, escalating privileges, and moving laterally. CISA added CVE-2026-102764 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog on Oct. 16, 2026. CISA urges organizations with affected self-hosted Remote Support appliances to immediately take the following actions: Apply the BT26-05-RS patch, as outlined in BeyondTrust’s Security Advisory BT26-05 . Organizations on a self-hosted Remote Support version older than 24.3.1 will need to upgrade to a newer version to apply the patch. Organizations using BeyondTrust-hosted (SaaS) Remote Support deployments have already been patched. Review BeyondTrust’s blog ARMORY CASTLE and BT26-05: What Security Teams Need to Know for detailed information on the vulnerability and recommended response and mitigation actions. Limit external access to the Remote Support appliance to the services needed to support users and customers. Restrict access to administrative interfaces to trusted networks. Review BeyondTrust’s B Series Appliance on-premises security for additional guidance on securing network connectivity for self-hosted Remote Support appliances. Or

CVE-2026-48356 Adobe Commerce and Magento Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type Vulnerability CVE-2026-111497 Google Brotli Unchecked Return Value Vulnerability These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-04: Prioritizing Security Updates Based on Risk establishes vulnerability management requirements for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. BOD 26-04 reinforces the importance of the KEV Catalog and requires federal agencies to prioritize rapid remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities, specifically those identified by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) listed in CISA’s KEV Catalog on publicly exposed assets that grant total control of the asset post-exploitation, while deferring action for lower-risk vulnerabilities. BOD 26-04 further establishes basic expectations for when agencies must check whether threat actors compromised the system before the patch was applied. While BOD 26-04 applies only to FCEB agencies, CISA encourages all organizations to adopt risk-based vulnerability management and prioritize remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities . CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria . Aware of an exploited vulnerability n

> Our Threat Research Unit published a breakdown of “The Gentlemen” - a Russian-speaking ransomware-as-a-service group that emerged in mid-2025, reportedly after affiliates split off from established groups like LockBit and Qilin. A few things that stood out from the research: They’re offering affiliates up to 90% of ransom revenue - aggressive even by RaaS standards Claimed 800+ victims across the US and Europe, making them one of the top RaaS groups this year Cross-platform ransomware variants targeting Windows, Linux, NAS, and BSD Active use of EDR-killing tooling - one recent incident involved a custom dropper abusing vulnerable Safetica ProcessMonitor and Lenovo BootRepair.sys drivers (BYOVD) A breach of the group’s own infrastructure gave researchers rare visibility into their affiliate network, tooling, and ties to the broader ransomware ecosystem Full technical writeup linked below for anyone who wants to dig into the IOCs and affiliate details. https://www.acronis.com/en/tru/posts/the-gentlemen-a-closer-look-at-a-not-so-gentle-ransomware-as-a-service-operation/ submitted by /u/acronis [link] [comments]

> CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog and updated the PHP Alert, Critical Vulnerabilities in PHP Require Immediate Patching : CVE-2026-109618 – PHP Memory Corruption Vulnerability CVE-2026-109619 – PHP Stale Internal Request-State Vulnerability These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 26-04: Prioritizing Security Updates Based on Risk establishes vulnerability management requirements for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. BOD 26-04 reinforces the importance of the KEV Catalog and requires federal agencies to prioritize rapid remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities, specifically those identified by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) listed in CISA’s KEV Catalog on publicly exposed assets that grant total control of the asset post-exploitation, while deferring action for lower-risk vulnerabilities. BOD 26-04 further establishes basic expectations for when agencies must check whether threat actors compromised the system before the patch was applied. While BOD 26-04 applies only to FCEB agencies, CISA encourages all organizations to adopt risk-based vulnerability management and prioritize remediation of KEV Catalog vulnerabilities . CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria . Aware of an exploited vulnerability not curre

> CISA strongly urges organizations to immediately patch the recently disclosed critical vulnerabilities in PHP, CVE-2026-109618 and CVE-2026-109619 . These vulnerabilities, known as “php2shell,” allow for unauthenticated remote code execution in PHP and affect all PHP installations serving web requests. Organizations should immediately update to PHP 8.5.12, 8.4.27, 8.3.36, or 8.2.35 to fix these vulnerabilities. While CISA has not observed exploitation of these vulnerabilities as of the time of publication, they pose a risk to organizations if left unpatched. CISA urges organizations to take the following actions: Identify and inventory systems running any version of PHP across your organization. PHP is often a component of other software and prevalence may not be directly observable. Apply the patch immediately, prioritizing internet-facing systems. Organizations that cannot update immediately, or that continue to use PHP 8.1 or earlier unsupported versions, should take PHP-based systems offline until they can be patched or updated. A web application firewall may provide some protection until systems are updated or patched. Review the official PHP security advisory for guidance on patching. Monitor for suspicious activity, including PHP worker processes launching shells or downloading tools. CISA urges network defenders to review the following advisory and apply necessary updates: Security Advisory: Critical Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities, Update Now Disclaimer The inf

  - Falsification criterion: If WAF / firewall / IDS show no exploit-signature hits for CVE-2026-109618 in the last 30 days, in-the-wild exploitation against us is unsupported.
  - Data sources: WAF logs, IDS/IPS, Edge firewall, CDN logs
  - Suggested query: `edge_logs | where signature contains 'CVE' or uri matches /exploit-pattern-for-CVE-2026-109618/ | summarize count() by src_ip, dst_host`
- **[H-5314d1ea-1-O3] Patch-status correlation** _(difficulty: easy · 100 pts · MITRE: T1190)_
  - Falsification criterion: If MDM / patch-management shows 100% deployment of the CVE-2026-109618 fix across exposed hosts, the hypothesis is disproven by remediation.
  - Data sources: SCCM/Intune, Patch management, Tanium / Kandji
  - Suggested query: `patch_state | where kb in (fixes_for('CVE-2026-109618')) | summarize coverage = avg(installed) by host_role`
- **[H-5314d1ea-1-O4] Post-exploit web-shell sweep** _(difficulty: medium · 250 pts · MITRE: T1505.003, T1059)_
  - Falsification criterion: If a sweep of webroots and IIS/Apache process trees finds no anomalous children (cmd, powershell, /bin/sh) on the affected product hosts, post-exploit foothold is unsupported.
  - Data sources: EDR process telemetry, File integrity monitoring
  - Suggested query: `process | where parent in ('w3wp.exe','httpd','nginx','java') and child in ('cmd.exe','powershell.exe','/bin/sh','/bin/bash')`
- **[H-5314d1ea-1-O5] Honeypot / canary check** _(difficulty: hard · 300 pts · MITRE: T1190)_
  - Falsification criterion: If exposed canary instances of the same product show no probing or exploitation telemetry, opportunistic mass-exploitation against the org is unlikely.
  - Data sources: Honeypot logs, Canary tokens
  - Suggested query: `canary_events | where product == '<product>' | where event_type in ('probe','exploit') | summarize by src_ip`

#### H-5314d1ea-2 · Outbound C2 beaconing to reported infrastructure  _(confidence: medium)_

**Statement.** Hosts in the estate are beaconing to the command-and-control infrastructure reported in this article (domains, IPs, TLS fingerprints, or RMM tooling).

**Why this hypothesis?** Archetype 'c2_beacon' selected based on CVEs cited: CVE-2026-109618, CVE-2026-109619; vectors: exploit.
